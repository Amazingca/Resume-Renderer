body=Basically, just a very long string of text that's meant to see how well line wrapping is on the thing. Really not so sure how difficult this will be to implement, but we'll see.
bullets=Here's long bullet point #1. I honestly think that we might be able to just pull this off without any disaster, but honestly we'll see.,,Shorter row here,,Here's another long row just to see how well the wrapper does with these new-lines. If we can do multi-stacking with them then I'm sure it'll scale to production-level resumes.
